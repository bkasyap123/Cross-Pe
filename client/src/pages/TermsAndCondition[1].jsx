Payment Accounts <br/>denominated in these currencies are held with banks established either in the <br/>country of origin of the currency or in another country.<br/><br/>

6.3 You may provide your Account Credentials to the Platforms<br/> from whom you wish to receive payment through the Services. <br/>You acknowledge and confirm that the Services are not a bank account and you are not permitted<br/> to carry out any activity that falls outside the scope of our <br/>Services. You agree not to conduct any direct communication with any bank or <br/>Service Provider that is involved in the provision of the Services unless<br/> such communication is approved by us in writing.

As an illustration only but not otherwise, payments shall typically<br/> arrive at your Payment Account within one (1) to three (3)<br/> Business Days from the date of remittance but there is no guarantee. If an <br/>Inbound Payment is not received within five (5) Business Days from the payment <br/>instruction of the relevant Platform, we may initiate an internal investigation on<br/> your behalf upon your request.

7 Withdrawing Funds
<br/><br/>
7.1 You may receive Funds only in your Beneficiary Account<br/> approved by us. We may refuse to carry out any Withdrawal <br/>Instruction to any Beneficiary Account that is not under your name or to a bank account <br/>that you are not the beneficial holder.<br/><br/>

7.2 After the completion of a Platform Transaction and when <br/>your Balance is positive, you may submit a Withdrawal <br/>Instruction to instruct us to transfer part or all of the Balance to your Beneficiary <br/>Account, net of Fees. The Withdrawal Instruction must include the following information:<br/><br/>
(a) the amount requested in the currency corresponding to the <br/>Funds received from the Platform; and<br/><br/>
(b) valid Beneficiary Account details.<br/><br/>

7.3 With respect to Beneficiary Account details:<br/><br/>
(a) You shall ensure that your Beneficiary Account information is true, accurate,<br/> and complete. We shall in no event be held responsible for Funds being sent to the wrong<br/> bank account as a result of your provision of untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete <br/>Beneficiary Account information. In the event that the payment is rejected due to untrue, inaccurate,<br/> or incomplete Beneficiary Account information provided by you, you shall solely be responsible for <br/>relevant Fees and we may directly deduct such Fees from your Balance.<br/> In case of any incorrect or misdirected payment, we shall take reasonable measures to assist you<br/> with tracing and, if reasonably feasible, recovering such payments, but we shall in no event be liable for any payments t<br/>hat cannot be recovered. All our additional costs in relation thereto shall be borne by you.<br/><br/>
(b) You shall ensure that your Beneficiary Account is in good standing and able to<br/>receive Funds. If your Beneficiary Account bank rejects the Withdrawal Transaction from us,<br/> Funds will be held with us until a valid Beneficiary Account is provided. All<br/> costs associated therewith shall be borne by you.<br/><br/>
(c) Crosspe shall be entitled to reject any Beneficiary Accounts that do not comply<br/> with Crosspe’s compliance requirements and/or if payments to such Beneficiary Account<br/> would violate Applicable Laws. You shall provide another Beneficiary Account so <br/>that we can continue to provide the Services to you.<br/><br/>

7.4 Once you submit a Withdrawal Instruction to us to execute the Withdrawal<br/> Transaction and debit the Beneficiary Account with the amount of the transfer and all applicable<br/> Fees, the withdrawals to your Beneficiary Account shall be irrevocable and<br/> you will not be able to refund the Funds transferred <br/>into your Beneficiary Account.<br/><br/>
<br/>
7.5 After receiving the Withdrawal Instruction, we will initiate a Withdrawal<br/> Transaction in the amount and currency you selected, less any Fees. Any Fees charged by the <br/>bank of your Beneficiary Account shall be your sole responsibility and we shall<br/> not be liable for such fees.<br/><br/>

7.6 We reserve the right to offset from any Balance any amounts owed to Crosspe <br/>by you, including, but not limited to, all Fees payable under this Agreement.<br/><br/>

7.7 Withdrawal Instructions received by Crosspe will be processed within one <br/>(1) to three (3) Business Days at the currency exchange rate as detailed in Section 9.3 below.<br/><br/>

7.8 We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, settle your Balance to your <br/>Beneficiary Account if the Balance is not withdrawn by you for a period from time to time <br/>specified by us in accordance with the Applicable Laws or if the applicable <br/>laws require us to do so.<br/><br/>
8 Outbound Payment

8.1 You shall ensure that any Outbound Payment Order is accompanied with the<br/> following information, if applicable:<br/><br/>
(a) the amount and currency under which the Outbound Payment Order has to be<br/> executed;<br/><br/>
(b) the name of the relevant Payee;<br/><br/>
(c) the international bank account number or, where relevant<br/>, the payment account details of the relevant Payee; and<br/><br/>
(d) any other information required by us to proceed with the <br/>Outbound Payment Order, including, without limitation, the underlying transaction <br/>details and documents, which will include any information necessary for us to comply with the <br/>Applicable Laws.<br/><br/>

8.2 Crosspe may refuse to execute an Outbound Payment Order in <br/>case of a technical issue or if the information provided by the Customer is untrue,<br/> inaccurate, or incomplete. Information regarding this refusal shall be available to the<br/> Customer on the Account as long as the relevant Outbound Payment Order remains impossible to process.<br/><br/>

8.3 The time of receipt of an Outbound Payment Order, the time<br/> of execution, and the value date are determined as follows:<br/><br/>
(a) Time of receipt. The time of receipt of an Outbound Payment<br/> Order is the time when the Outbound Payment Order is actually received by Crosspe.<br/> If the Outbound Payment Order is received by Crosspe after the cut-off time (set by Crosspe’s <br/>contracting entity) on a Business Day or on a day which is not a Business Day, the Outbound Payment<br/> Order shall be deemed to have been received on the immediate succeeding Business Day for Crosspe’s<br/> contracting entity. Once the Outbound Payment Order is received by Crosspe, it shall be irrevocable.<br/><br/>
(b) Time of execution. After receipt of an Outbound Payment Order,<br/> Crosspe shall ensure that the amount of the Outbound Payment is credited to the<br/> payee’s bank or payment service provider’s account at the latest by the end of the Business <br/>Day immediately succeeding receipt of the Outbound Payment Order.<br/><br/>
(c) Value date. The debit value date for the Customer acting as payer<br/> shall be no earlier than the point in time at which the amount of the Outbound<br/>Payment Order is debited from the Payment Account.<br/><br/><br/>
(d) The time limits. The time limits prescribed above are usual time <br/>limits and apply only subject to the Payment Account Balance being positive and <br/>showing sufficient Funds for Crosspe to proceed with the requested Outbound Payment Order.<br/> For the sake of clarity, the time may be extended due to practical circumstances <br/>which we shall inform <br/>you accordingly.<br/><br/>

9 Fees<br/><br/>

9.1 Crosspe shall advise you of all Fees that may be charged by <br/>us against you through the Account. Acting reasonably, and following<br/> notice to you, we may from time to time adjust existing Fees or introduce new Fees. You shall pay all <br/>Fees as from time to time adjusted by us and your continued use of the Crosspe Services <br/>indicates your continued acceptance of the Fees. When we adjust our Fees, we will publish the updated Fees in your<br/> Account portal, website, and may send you an Email notification (if required). If you have any q<br/>uestions or are unclear as to any Fees, you should contact our Customer Support.<br/><br/>

9.2 Fees payable by you will be deducted from the Payment Account and will be charged<br/> when the Transaction is executed. You hereby authorize and instruct us to deduct such Fees.<br/><br/>

9.3 Your Transaction may be subject to currency conversions. If the Transaction involves<br/> a currency conversion, it will be completed at the foreign exchange rate at the applicable transaction <br/>time as determined by us at our sole and absolute discretion. To avoid the fluctuation<br/> of the foreign exchange rate, the foreign exchange rate of each Transaction will be <br/>determined when it is processed. Therefore, subject to the Applicable Laws, the foreign <br/>exchange rate prior to the Transaction provided by us is for reference only, and the actual foreign<br/> exchange rate during the Transaction shall prevail. You acknowledge and confirm that you <br/>shall be bound by the applicable exchange rate from time to time.<br/><br/>

10 Termination and Suspension<br/><br/>

10.1 If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Account, you may simply discontinue<br/> using the Services.

10.2 We may suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time,<br/> with or without cause. Where possible, we may provide at least seven (7) days’ prior notice by <br/>email, unless there are exceptional circumstances or regulatory circumstances (including but <br/>not limited to court or governmental orders) causing us to take immediate action,<br/> such as where we discover that you have provided false, misleading, untrue, incomplete, o<br/>r inaccurate information or have otherwise acted dishonestly; (b) you commit a breach of this Agreement <br/>or any other agreement you enter into with Crosspe; (c) your Account has been compromised <br/>or for other security reasons; (d) you engage in fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities or<br/> we reasonably suspect the same; (e) you use Services illegally or fraudulently in violation of Applicable Law or <br/>we reasonably suspect the same; or (f) there are other grounds that we consider appropriate.

10.3 When your Account is suspended or terminated, any further attempted use of the Service<br/> will result in your Funds being rejected and returned to the Platform and may warrant notification <br/>to appropriate authorities. You are solely responsible for any fees incurred in connection with the rejected payments.<br/><br/>

10.4 All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive<br/> termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity,<br/> and limitations of liability.<br/><br/>

15 Limitation of Liability<br/><br/>

15.1 In no event will Crosspe, or its Service Providers, be liable with <br/>respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict<br/> liability, or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental, or <br/>consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute services; (iii) for interruption of <br/>use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you<br/> to Crosspe under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of <br/>action. Crosspe shall have no liability for any failure or delay due<br/> to matters beyond its reasonable control.<br/><br/>

15.2 In respect of any Inbound Payment, you hereby release the Platform from<br/> liability for such payment as of when the Funds related thereto are actually <br/>received by us and not as of that later time when the Funds are settled to you by us.<br/><br/>

15.3 Outbound Payment Orders can only be executed if they comply with<br/> regulatory standards. We will not be held liable for any damages which could result<br/> from the non-execution or defective execution of an Outbound Payment Order where such <br/>non-execution or defective execution is due to the fact that the Customer provided information which <br/>was untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or incorrect. In the case of paying VAT in the European Union, <br/>Outbound Payment Orders shall be executed according to the relevant Approved Payee’s<br/> international bank account number (IBAN) provided that such bank account is held with a bank <br/>in the European Union (the “Unique Identifier”). In the case of a discrepancy between the Unique<br/> Identifier provided by the Customer and any other information, we may, without incurring any liability, rely solely on the Unique Identifier.<br/> In such case, the Funds under the relevant Outbound Payment Order transmitted by the Customer <br/>will be deemed to have been transferred to the intended beneficiary. If the Unique Identifier provided by the Customer is incorrect, <br/>we will not be held liable for any damages which could result from the non-execution or defective execution of the Outbound Payment<br/> Order so long as Crosspe has executed such Outbound Payment Order in accordance with the indicated Unique Identifier.<br/> The Customer will assume sole responsibility therefor and reimburse all<br/> costs of Crosspe.<br/><br/>

15.4 You acknowledge that Crosspe may provide the Services using facilities<br/> provided by banks, payment service providers, clearing networks, and other <br/>third-party payment processing services. No commercial agreement exists between the Service<br/> Providers and yourself, and each of the Service Providers will accordingly have no direct liability to you.<br/><br/>

15.5 We shall not be liable for any underlying sales transactions occurring <br/>on the Platform between either you or a Buyer. It is your responsibility to<br/> ensure that you only make payments to or receive payments from persons or entities related <br/>to commercial transactions in compliance with your applicable legal obligations. Crosspe has no <br/>influence on the underlying process of buying or selling goods/services, and no legal relationship<br/> with the Platform or Buyers, and will not be made liable to or in respect of any <br/>Buyer or Platform or for the underlying products and/or services being sold or bought, nor for the <br/>correct completion of any sale or purchase of goods or services. You assume exclusive responsibility <br/>for your product and your obligations to Buyers and Platforms and shall indemnify and hold Crosspe harmless from any claim by any of them <br/>against Crosspe. The sale of counterfeit goods or goods breaching intellectual property rights can<br/> also lead to legal action by rights holders and a potential loss of Funds. If you are in doubt as to the legality of a transaction,<br/> you should not continue with your payment. Refunds and cancellations are not allowed on Crosspe.<br/><br/>

15.6 You shall solely be responsible for reporting to all applicable government tax<br/> authorities all Funds underlying your use of the Services and for the<br/> payment of any applicable taxes that apply to such payments as well as any other applicable <br/>reporting requirements including, but not limited to, any customs or foreign currency controls.<br/> We may request you to provide proof of payment of taxes as and when it considers necessary and appropriate.<br/><br/>

15.7 Neither party shall be held liable or considered to have failed under these rules<br/> in case of late or non-performance when their cause is related to a <br/>force majeure situation as defined by the governing law defined in Section 3.<br/><br/>
<br/>

The aggregate maximum liability of Crosspe under this Agreement (including any and all <br/>claims for breach of this Agreement) for all events shall not exceed 105% of the Fees c<br/>ollected by Crosspe from you for the 12 months immediately before such events.<br/>

15.9 EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,<br/> AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR <br/>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ALL RELATED<br/> COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER <br/>OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE,<br/> OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT <br/>LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT<br/> AND ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS, STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN <br/>IF COMPANY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON<br/> THE PART OF COMPANY, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, AND UNDER NO <br/>CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE,<br/> INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/><br/>

17.5 Severability. Should one or several provisions of these general terms and conditions <br/>be or become invalid or prove to be unenforceable, this shall not affect the<br/> validity of the other provisions.

If any provision of these Terms <br/>is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will <br/>remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement<br/> between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.<br/><br/>
18 Terms for OPGSP Services<br/><br/>

Crosspe doesn’t act as an Online Payment Gateway Service Provider (“OPGSP”) <br/>(as prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India) (“OPGSP”) in India for the purpose of facilitating<br/> certain payment services. Crosspe partners with a Service provider licensed and regulated <br/>by Reserve Bank of India as an OPGSP provider. The customer in India may be eligible to use these<br/> Services to receive payments (but not to make outbound) via this Service Provider as OPGSP,<br/> as described in the foregoing Terms and Conditions, subject to the terms set<br/> forth by such Service Provider and notified via email, website, and other channels.<br/><br/>

You may use the Services for export of such goods and services as permitted <br/>under the laws of India, including but not limited to the prevalent Foreign Trade Policy of India,<br/> and in all cases only for lawful and valid transactions and not for any prohibited transaction<br/> as detailed in the Terms and Conditions.<br/><br/>

When withdrawing, you must indicate the purpose of the transactions underlying<br/> the Eligible Inbound, as requested under India regulations to enable collection of data relating <br/>to the transactions as foreign exchange transactions. Failure to provide Crosspe with <br/>accurate information shall be your sole responsibility. We will not be liable for withdrawn funds<br/> being sent to the wrong bank account as a result of you providing incorrect details. <br/>Providing inaccurate information regarding your bank account may result in rejection of <br/>funds and/or blocking your use of the Services.<br/><br/>

Eligible Inbound received by Service Provider on your behalf as OPGSP will be<br/> maintained in a Nostro collection account of an Authorized Dealer Bank in India, until being<br/> transferred exclusively to your designated bank account subject to the applicable law.<br/><br/>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may use Crosspe Outbound Services of VAT to<br/> pay your VAT bill to the tax authority, and the amount equal to the underlying amount of your<br/> VAT payment will be redirected to the VAT authority, instead of being transferred to your bank account.<br/><br/>

19 Purchases<br/><br/>

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“Purchase”), <br/>you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including <br/>but not limited to, your credit or debit card number, the expiration date of your card, <br/>your billing address, and your shipping information.
